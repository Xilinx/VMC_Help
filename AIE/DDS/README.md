## Library

AI Engine/DSP/Buffer IO

## Description

This block implements the Direct Digital Synthesizer (DDS) targeted for
AI Engines and uses buffer interface.

## Parameters

### Main  
#### Output data type  
Sets the output data type.

#### Samples per frame  
Specifies the number of samples in the output frame. The value must be in the range of 8 to 1024 and the default value is 32.

<div class="noteBox">
Increasing the number of samples per frame increases the output throughput.
</div>

#### Reload initial phase via input port
Allows the intial phase to be reloaded during simulation via an input port.

#### Phase increment  
Specifies the phase increment between samples. The value must be in the
range 0 to 2^31 and the default value is 0.

  Phase increment is calculated using the formula `(Fo\*(2^N)) / Fs`.

  Where:
  - Fo = Output frequency
  - N = 32, which represents the accumulator width, and it is fixed
  - Fs = Sampling frequency

For example, for a sampling frequency of 1 Gsps and output frequency of 100 MHz, the Phase Increment should be `2^32/10`.

#### Rounding mode

Describes the selection of rounding to be applied during the shift down stage of processing.

The following modes are available:
* **Floor:** Truncate LSB, always round down (towards negative infinity).
* **Ceiling:** Always round up (towards positive infinity).
* **Round to positive infinity:** Round halfway towards positive infinity.
* **Round to negative infinity:** Round halfway towards negative infinity.
* **Round symmetrical to infinity:** Round halfway towards infinity (away from zero).
* **Round symmetrical to zero:** Round halfway towards zero (away from infinity).
* **Round convergent to even:** Round halfway towards nearest even number.
* **Round convergent to odd:** Round halfway towards nearest odd number.

No rounding is performed on the **Floor** or **Ceiling** modes. Other modes round to the nearest integer. They differ only in how they round for values that are exactly between two integers.

#### Saturation mode

Describes the selection of saturation to be applied during the shift down stage of processing.

The following modes are available:
* **None:** No saturation is performed and the value is truncated on the MSB side.
* **Asymmetric:** Rounds an n-bit signed value in the range `-2^(n-1)` to `2^(n-1)-1`.
* **Symmetric:** Rounds an n-bit signed value in the range `-2^(n-1)-1` to `2^(n-1)-1`.

#### Sample time  
Specifies the sample time for the output signal.

<div class="noteBox">
The propagated block sample time in Simulink is equal to "Sample time" multipled by "Samples per frame".
</div>

### Constraints
Click on the button given here to access the constraint manager and add or update constraints for each kernel. If you set the "Number of cascade stages" parameter to a value greater than one, multiple kernels will be used to process the input. You can use the constraint manager to optimize the performance of your design by setting specific constraints for each kernel (in this case, you need to first run your design). Adding constraints will not affect the functional simulation in Simulink. Constraints will only affect the generated graph code, cycle approximate AIE simulation (System C), and behavior in hardware.

<div class="noteBox">
If you are using non-default constraints for any of the kernels for the block, an asterisk (*) will be displayed next to the button.
</div>
