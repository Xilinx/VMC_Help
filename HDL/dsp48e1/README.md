# DSP48E1

The DSP48E1 block is an efficient building block for DSP
applications that use Virtex®-7 series devices. Enhancements to
the DSP48E1 slice provide improved flexibility and utilization, improved
efficiency of applications, reduced overall power consumption, and
increased maximum frequency. The high performance allows designers to
implement multiple slower operations in a single DSP48E1 slice using
time-multiplexing methods.

## Description

The DSP48E1 slice supports many independent functions. These functions
include multiply, multiply accumulate (MACC), multiply add, three-input
add, barrel shift, wide-bus multiplexing, magnitude comparator, bit-wise
logic functions, pattern detect, and wide counter. The architecture also
supports cascading multiple DSP48E1 slices to form wide math functions,
DSP filters, and complex arithmetic without the use of general FPGA.

## Parameters

### Basic tab  
Parameters specific to the Basic tab are as follows.

#### Input configuration  
##### A or ACIN input  
Specifies if the A input should be taken directly from the a port or
from the cascaded acin port. The acin port can only be connected to
another DSP48 block.

##### B or BCIN input  
Specifies if the B input should be taken directly from the b port or
from the cascaded bcin port. The bcin port can only be connected to
another DSP48 block.

**Note**: If the input to the block is NaN, you will see a behavioral
simulation mismatch.

#### DSP48E1 data-path configuration  
##### SIMD Mode of Adder/Subtractor/Accumulator  
This mode can be used to implement small add-subtract functions at high
speed and lower power with less logic utilization. The adder and
subtractor in the adder/subtracter/logic unit can also be split into two
24-bit units or four 12-bit units.

##### Do not use multiplier  
When selected, the block is optimized in hardware for maximum
performance without using the multiplier. If an instruction using the
multiplier is encountered in simulation, an error is reported.

##### Use dynamic multiplier mode  
When selected, it instructs the block to use the dynamic multiplier
mode. This indicates that the block is switching between A\*B and A:B
operations on the fly and therefore needs to get the worst-case timing
of the two paths.

##### Use Preadder  
Use the 25-bit D data input to the pre-adder or alternative input to the
multiplier. The pre-adder implements D + A as determined by the INMODE3
signal.

#### Pattern Detection  
##### Reset p register on pattern detection  
If selected and the pattern is detected, reset the p register on the
next cycle

#### Pattern Input  
##### Pattern Input from c port  
When selected, the pattern used in pattern detection is read from the c
port.

###### Pattern Input  
* Pattern Input from c port:  
When selected, the pattern used in pattern detection is read from the c
port.

* Using Pattern Attribute (48bit hex value):  
Value is used in pattern detection logic which is best described as an
equality check on the output of the adder/subtracter/logic unit

* Pattern attribute:  
A 48-bit value that is used in the pattern detector.

###### Mask Input:  
* Mask input from c port  
When selected, the mask used in pattern detection is read from the c
port.

* Using Mask Attribute (48 bit hex value):  
Enter a 48-bit value used to mask out certain bits during pattern
detection.

* MODE1:  
Selects rounding_mode 1.

* MODE2:  
Selects rounding_mode 2.
 

### Optional Ports tab  
Parameters specific to the Optional Ports tab are:

#### Input Ports  
##### Consolidate control port  
When selected, combines the opmode, alumode, carry_in,
carry_in_sel, and inmode ports into one 20-bit port. Bits 0 to 6 are
the opmode, bits 7 to 10 are the alumode port, bit 11 is the
carry_in port, bits 12 to 14 are the carry_in_sel port, and bits
15-19 are the inmode bits. This option should be used when the Opmode
block is used to generate a DSP48 instruction.

out port of another DSP48E block.

##### Provide carryout port  
When selected, the carryout output port is made available. When the
mode of operation for the adder/subtractor is set to one 48-bit adder,
the carryout port is 1-bit wide. When the mode of operation is set to
two 24 bit adders, the carryout port is 2 bits wide. The MSB
corresponds to the second adder's carryout and the LSB corresponds to
the first adder's carryout. When the mode of operation is set to four 12
bit adders, the carryout port is 4 bits wide with the bits
corresponding to the addition of the 48 bit input split into 4 12-bit
sections.

provided. When the inverse of the pattern, either from the mask or the c
register, is matched the pattern bar detection port is set to '1'.

##### Provide overflow port  
When selected, the overflow output port is provided. This port indicates
when the operation in the DSP48E has overflowed beyond the bit P\[N\]

mask whether set by the GUI mask field or the c port input.

##### Provide underflow port  
When selected, the underflow output port is provided. This port
indicates when the operation in the DSP48E has underflowed. Underflow

input.

cascade in port of another DSP48E block and is used to support 96-bit
accumulators/adders and subtracters which are built from two DSP48Es.
